# Udacity Android Kotlin Nanodegree project

2nd project in the Udacity Nanodegree program reviewing MVVM Architecture, RecyclerView, Room, Retrofit and Worker.

The app updates the data everyday through the NASA API. Uses a RecyclerView to show a list of the upcoming asteroids within the next week. And also shows the image of the day.
